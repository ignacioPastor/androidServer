Server created in Express using Node and JavaScript to give support to an Android App developed in my studies of DAM.

It's a simple server to allow the user of the app to login and get who of his contacts have the app intalled.
The app consist in a Friend Finder, where you can see positioned in a map the people of your contacts that have the app installed.
